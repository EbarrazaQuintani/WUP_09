# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

## Build the best regression model you can that predicts the weight of perch
## Using only two predictor variables  


# Perch
```{r}
perch <- filter(allthat,Species=="Perch")
perch <- select(perch,-1)
```


```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets( Weight ~ .,
               data = perch,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")

library(car)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="bottomright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```

This perch model shows us that the best two plots to find the best weight is to use Height and Width.
